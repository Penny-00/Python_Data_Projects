# üìä Overview

üëã Welcome to My Data Job Market Analysis. This project offers a focused exploration of the data job landscape, with an emphasis on Data Analyst roles. It was born from a personal need to better understand the job market and identify high-impact opportunities within the field.

Using a dataset provided in [Luke Barousse‚Äôs Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs) which provides rich details on job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills, I conducted a series of Python-driven analyses to answer key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

The goal is to provide actionable insights for anyone pursuing or advancing a career in data analytics.

# ‚ùì Key Questions Explored
This project aims to answer the following questions:

- Which skills are most in demand for the top three most common data roles?
- What are the current trends in skill demand specifically for Data Analyst positions?
- How do salaries compare across different skills and job titles within data analytics?
- Which skills offer the best value for Data Analysts, those that are both High Demand AND High Paying?

# üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - Pandas Library: Used extensively for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.

# üßπ Data Preparation & Cleaning
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data
I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.
```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```



# üìä The Analysis
Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To identify the most in-demand skills for the top three data roles, I first filtered the dataset to find the most popular job titles. Then, I extracted the top five skills associated with each of these roles. This analysis reveals which skills are most relevant based on the specific data role I'm aiming for.

### Visualize Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')

    
plt.show()
```
### Results

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb](3_Project\4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

#### Visualize Data

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)  
plt.show()
```
#### Results
![Salary Distribution of Data Jobs in the US](3_Project/Images/salary_distrubution.png)

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)

# Top 10 highest paying Data Analyst skills
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, ax=ax[0], hue='median', palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 most in-demand Data Analyst skills

sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, ax=ax[1], hue='median', palette='light:b')

plt.show()
```
#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:
